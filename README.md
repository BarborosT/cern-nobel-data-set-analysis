#### Hello,

In this study, I analyzed the relationships of Nobel Prize-winning physicists with CERN. I have studied the work and contributions of physicists who have won the Nobel Prize for analysis at CERN since the years when they won the prize.

For my analysis, I created a database using the list of Nobel Prize winners on the official website of the Nobel Foundation and the data I obtained from their work on the official website of CERN. This database contains the works and contributions of each Nobel Prize winner at CERN from the year he won the prize.

As a result of my analysis, I found that the relations of Nobel Prize-winning physicists with CERN are quite tight, and a large part of their contributions to CERN's important work in the field of modern physics led to them being awarded the prize.

The results of this analysis can be an important resource for employees and researchers in the field of modern physics and can help plan future studies.

Have a good read.
